supr:signal is a custom firmware for Atom Matrix that allows users to control the LEDs freely — to draw emojis, animate patterns, or display any useful information. It also supports messages and uses the first row as a channel to communicate the device status.

_**If you want to craft supr:signal, a 3D-printable model is available in the assets directory.**_
